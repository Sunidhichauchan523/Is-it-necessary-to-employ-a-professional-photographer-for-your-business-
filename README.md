# Is-it-necessary-to-employ-a-professional-photographer-for-your-business-
When it comes to business expenses, professional photography is often the item on your list that is seen as unnecessary. Whether you are a new business, building your eCommerce store, or a well-established business trying to upgrade your e-store, the cost of hiring a digital photography service might make you think twice about hiring one. You could always click pictures yourself or even use stock photos. That might help you save some money. <br>
If you are thinking in that manner, you are absolutely, 100%, incorrect. <br>
In reality, every business and service, no matter the industry, can benefit from having professional photographs on their website. <br>
Why professional photography is important <br>
When running an eCommerce store, the only way you can convince your clients to buy your products or even consider buying them is through the pictures you decide to use on your website. You might write how amazing your products are, their benefits, use, etc., but unless the images you use are not eye-catching and detail-oriented, the client will not be convinced about buying them. <br>
•	Attract the attention of your customers <br>
The human brain takes about 13 milliseconds to process an image- that means you do not have a lot of time to impress your customers. What clients see on your site is often a deciding factor in whether they will stay on your site or lose all interest, therefore it is important that you invest in building a store that is eye-catching and attractive enough to make them stay longer. One of the most important steps to do this is through great product photography. <br>

•	Conveys the quality of your products <br>
Along with great products, some of the best eCommerce stores also have great photos of their goods. This is because the images of your articles testify to their quality and value, and also establish transparency in your business.  You could sell the most well-made and beautiful products, but if the photography is poor, they will look poor. It is important that you look for the best digital photography services in Pune, who can help you take great photographs of your service or goods. <br>

•	Incredibly versatile <br>
Professional photographs are very versatile and can be used on all types of media platforms. From your website to email banners, social media posts, or even print advertisements, you can use the photographs just about everywhere. On the other hand, amateur photos are often too pixelated and are of low quality to be used on multiple platforms. <br>
•	Help in creating a brand identity <br>

Stock photos are an alternative that many businesses consider instead of hiring a professional photography service. While stock photos might serve your purpose, they are not the best way to showcase your products, as they are not photos of your business. <br>
When people visit your website, they want to get to know you. Stock photos don’t help them do that. Hiring professional photography services in Pune will help you capture the essence of your brand and help you establish a brand identity by bringing out what is unique about your business. <br>

•	Increase traffic to your website <br>
Websites with professional photographs receive up to 90% more traffic as compared to websites without.  Optimized photos will help your website be found through the image results of a search engine, help to engage customers, and will keep them on your website for longer. <br>
Conclusion <br>
Professional photography is a must for any business or service, as it will help you attract customers, increase traffic to your website, help you create a brand identity, can be used cross-platform, and convey the selling points and quality of your product/ service. So, although hiring a professional photographer might seem expensive, it will benefit your business greatly in the long run by increasing the engagement rates, and subsequently increasing your sales. This makes it a perfect and absolutely necessary investment for your business. <br>
